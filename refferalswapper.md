## What Does This Contract Do? - Simplified Explanation

At its core, the Alpha7 Swapper Contract is a smart contract on the blockchain that allows users to easily swap BNB (Binance Coin) for Alpha7 Tokens. What sets this contract apart is its built-in support for rewarding community moderators and contributing to the project's treasury without imposing any additional costs on the user.

Here's a simple breakdown of its functions:

1. **Swap BNB for Alpha7 Tokens**: Users send BNB to the contract, which automatically swaps it for Alpha7 Tokens using the Uniswap protocol, ensuring users receive their tokens directly and efficiently.

2. **Referral Rewards**: Moderators promoting the use of this contract are rewarded, receiving 1% of the transaction value in BNB. This incentive is designed to encourage community support and growth.

3. **Treasury Support**: A small portion of each transaction is allocated to the treasury wallet, supporting the ongoing development and sustainability of the Alpha7 project.
